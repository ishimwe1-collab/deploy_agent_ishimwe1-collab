Attendance Tracker Project Setup
Project Overview

This project provides an automated setup script for the Attendance Tracker application. 
The setup_project.sh script builds the project workspace, copies all necessary files, allows configuration of attendance thresholds, checks the Python environment, and handles interruptions gracefully.

The script ensures reproducibility, efficiency, and reliability in setting up your development environment.

Directory Structure Created

When the script runs, it creates a directory named:

attendance_tracker_<your_suffix>

Inside this folder, the structure is:
attendance_checker.py
Helpers/
    assets.csv
    config.json
reports/
    reports.log

Menu Options

When you run ./setup_project.sh, a menu is displayed to guide you through setup stages.

1) Create Main Directory

Prompts you for a suffix and creates the project folder:

attendance_tracker_<suffix>


This is the root of your project.

2) Create Internal Structure

Creates the necessary subdirectories:

Helpers/ → contains configuration and asset files

reports/ → stores log files

3) Copy Project Files

Copies all required files into the project directories:

attendance_checker.py → main Python logic

assets.csv → stored in Helpers/

config.json → stored in Helpers/

reports.log → stored in reports/

4) Configure Thresholds

Allows you to update attendance thresholds in config.json:

Warning threshold (default 75%)

Failure threshold (default 50%)

Press Enter to keep default values. Changes are automatically updated in config.json.

5) Python Environment Check

Checks if python3 is installed on your system.

If installed, displays the Python version

If not installed, warns you to install Python before running the project

6) Run Full Setup

Performs all steps automatically:

Creates the main directory

Creates internal structure

Copies all project files

Configures thresholds (interactive)

Checks Python environment

This is the recommended option for a complete and ready-to-use setup.

0) Exit

Exits the setup script without making any changes.

Ctrl+C Handling

The script is designed to handle interruptions gracefully:

If you press Ctrl+C at any point during setup, the script will:

Archive the current state of the project folder as:

attendance_tracker_<suffix>_archive.tar.gz


Delete the incomplete project folder to keep your workspace clean

You can later restore the archived folder using:

tar -xzf attendance_tracker_<suffix>_archive.tar.gz

Notes

All changes to config.json are done in-place using the script.

Default thresholds are preserved if you skip the update step.

The script uses colors to differentiate stages, success messages, warnings, and errors for clarity.

Example Usage

Run the script:

./setup_project.sh
